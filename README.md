# Visualizing Sample and Ontology linkages between HuBMAP and SPARC (hubmap-link)

We propose to visualize and report on the linkages between HuBMAP and SPARC. We will

1) look at the anatomical structures ontologically tagged by SPARC and find how they connect to the HuBMAP CCF / ASCT+B ontology terms
2) find how those common terms map to the 3D HuBMAP VHCCF reference system
3) map samples from SPARC to HuBMAP 
4) visualize the term overlaps 
5) and visualize the samples both from HuBMAP and SPARC in the same 3D reference system (CCF).

This study of the interlinkages between HuBMAP and SPARC ontologies and data could be very valuable in longitudinal studies and to further the goals of both HuBMAP and SPARC in cross-consortium interoperability.

See the [Project Description](DESCRIPTION.md) for more background information and initial resources for development.

## Tracking Development

Development will be tracked on the [Sprint Backlog](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/hubmap-link/projects/1).
